## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to create a dynamic background using separate elements rather than just one background image.


### Continued development

One thing I need to work on is using different CSS tools when completing challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools, specifically the border-radius shorthand, aligning items property, and how to use the background-position property.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to remind me how to center a container to the middle of the webpage.
